Graph Analysis on CORA Citation Network Dataset
This repository consists of the following implementations on the CORA dataset:

- Link Prediction using GraphSage
- Link Predictino using GCN
- Node Classification using MLP
- Node Classification using GCN

And for the purpose of evaluating the performance of each of these implementations, 4 metrics have been used: 
- F measure
- Recall
- AUC
- Precision
